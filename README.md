Flashcards to help with studying new words

# TODO

- [ ] make it so it saves players' progress (with cookies?)
- [ ] add a button to listen to the word
- [ ] make a program that checks the txt file and notifies if there are odd number of lines or there's an italan word ending with e (so I can check if I wrote the article [névelő] for it), and other things maybe
- [ ] make it so the user can chose how many words to learn
- [ ] make it so I can send a notification to everyone currently using the website to ask them to reload, because I changed stuff
- [ ] Fix a bug where the progress bar doesn't display stuff properly after starting a new pack (I think; idk how to replicate)
- [ ] Make a color flash animation for undoing (?)
- [x] make it so undo undoes even if I pressed an action button at the end of a deck (because normally it creates a new deck, and there's no logic to undo that rn)
- [x] display for example the player is at 6/51
- [x] add confimation for going back to menu (!!)
- [x] make it so all words start with uppercase letter (handle cases if the word doesn't start with a letter, but maybe js handles it already idk)
- [x] make it so the card is flipped to its 'hu' side when an action button is pressed or when it get's displayed (because otherwise, if I put it into the not-know deck, when it comes up again, it will be flipped to the wrong side)
- [x] have some sort of indication that all the words have been learned
- [x] make it so when pressing the tick or the x button, the card turns green or red for a brief moment with a nice animation
