Flashcards to help with studying new words

# TODO

- [ ] Add a progress indicator

  - [x] display for example the player is at 6/51
  - [ ] at the end display how much the player learned and needs to learn

- [x] add confimation for going back to menu (!!)
- [ ] make it so it saves players' progress (with cookies?)
- [x] make it so all words start with uppercase letter (handle cases if the word doesn't start with a letter, but maybe js handles it already idk)
- [x] make it so the card is flipped to its 'hu' side when an action button is pressed or when it get's displayed (because otherwise, if I put it into the not-know deck, when it comes up again, it will be flipped to the wrong side)
- [x] have some sort of indication that all the words have been learned
- [ ] make it so the user can chose how many words to learn
